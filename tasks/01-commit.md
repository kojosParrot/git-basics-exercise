# Task 1 — First commit

Goal: Make your first commit with a clear message.

Steps:

1) Open starter/hello.txt and add your name on a new line.
2) Save the file.
3) Stage and commit with a message like:
   "Add name to hello.txt"
4) Push (optional now; you will push after Task 2).

Hints:

- Use `git status` to see changes.
- Keep messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Update").
