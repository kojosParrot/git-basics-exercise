# Task 2 — Branch and Pull Request

Goal: Create a feature branch, add a new file, push, and open a PR.

Steps:

1) Create a new branch named `feature/bio`.
2) Create a file `bio.md` with:
   - Your name as a heading
   - 3 bullet points about you
3) Commit with a message like:
   "Add bio with three facts"
4) Push your branch to your GitHub fork.
5) On GitHub, open a Pull Request from `feature/bio` into `main` of YOUR fork.
6) Add a short PR description.

Hints:

- Use `git branch --show-current` to confirm you’re on the new branch.
- Use `git push -u origin feature/bio` the first time.
